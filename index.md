### CPSC 120

* [Lab 3](https://csufullerton.instructure.com/courses/3453286/assignments/37261545)

    Lab 3, part 1 was one of my favorite as there was a lot of math used with the formulas provided to calculate the output and I enjoy math a lot. The objective of this lab was to teach us how to use functions within a program to simplify the code. Another objective was to familiarize us with complex math equations that can be used in programming to accomplish certain tasks.

* [Lab 4](https://csufullerton.instructure.com/courses/3453286/assignments/37261546)

    Lab 4, part 2 was one of my favorites as the finished product was an interactive game that can be played by two people. I enjoy playing multiplayer games so this was right up my ally. The objective of this lab was to introduce us to conditional statements such as if and else and to work on a turn based program.

* [Lab 7](https://csufullerton.instructure.com/courses/3453286/assignments/37261549)

    Lab 7, part 2 was enjoyable for me as we looked at real life signs and based our program around it. This incorporated a realistic element to our program and made it fun to code. The objective of this lab was to familiarize us with if and else statements to properly display the message based on parameters set by the signs.
